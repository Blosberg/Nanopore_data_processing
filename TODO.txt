Todo: 

Currently: just fastq branch works so long as the output only goes as far as "bam"
The raw_MinION output will need to be further developed to get to the point of the reports (will probably crash now on its own)
 the goal:

   * have just-fastq input produce empty current-statistics file, and when the report recognizes that, skip the corresponding section
   * have the OUTPUT_FILES built for each sample independently, with a max-integer for each case; some may be raw_minION, some may be fastq.


 --- then start updating the report;  
* Incorporate statistics from Granges data into report.
